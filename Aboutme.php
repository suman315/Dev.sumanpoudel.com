I came to the UK 6 years ago from Nepal for my studies and really like it here so I decided to stay.
 I completed my HND in Software Development from Queensland college London.
<br><br>
I enjoy taking complex problems and turning them into simple and beautiful interface designs.I love all things technology related.
<br><br>
I also love the logic and structure of coding and always strive to write elegant and efficient code, whether it be HTML, CSS, PHP or JavaScript.
<br><br>
I’m always open to exciting job opportunities. </article>";
